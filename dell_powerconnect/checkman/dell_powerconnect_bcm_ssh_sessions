description:
 This check determines the currently active SSH sessions on Dell PowerConnect
 switches.

 This has currently been verified to work with the following Broadcom FastPath
 silicon based switch models:
   PowerConnect M6348,
   PowerConnect M8024-k

 {WARN} or {CRIT} is returned, if the number of currently active SSH sessions is
 above the given thresholds. {OK} is returned otherwise.

item:
 None.

inventory:
 The inventory creates a single service check for the number of SSH sessions.

examples:
 # Setting the warning and critical threshold values to 4 and 5 active SSH sessions.
 dell_powerconnect_bcm_ssh_sessions_default_levels = {
    'levels': (4, 5)
 }

perfdata:
 The value of the currently active SSH sessions.
