 This check determines the global status of the "product" on Dell PowerConnect
 switches.

 This has currently been verified to work with the following Broadcom FastPath
 silicon based switch models:
   PowerConnect M6348,
   PowerConnect M8024-k

 {OK} is returned, if the global switch status is 'ok'. From the MIB: "If
 fans and power supplies are functioning and the system did not reboot
 because of a HW watchdog failure or a SW fatal error condition."

 {WARN} is returned, if the global switch status is 'non-critical'. From
 the MIB: "If at least one power supply is not functional or the system
 rebooted at least once because of a HW watchdog failure or a SW fatal
 error condition."

 {CRIT} is returned, if the global switch status is 'critical'. From the
 MIB: "If at least one fan is not functional, possibly causing a dangerous
 warming up of the device."
