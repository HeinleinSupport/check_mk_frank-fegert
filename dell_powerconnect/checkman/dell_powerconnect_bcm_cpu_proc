description:
 This check determines the current per process CPU usage on Dell PowerConnect
 switches.

 This has currently been verified to work with the following Broadcom FastPath
 silicon based switch models:
   PowerConnect M6348,
   PowerConnect M8024-k

 {WARN} or {CRIT} is returned, if the total CPU usage in '%' is equal or higher
 than the given thresholds. {OK} is returned otherwise.

item:
 None.

inventory:
 The inventory creates a single service check for the per process CPU usage
 on the switch unit.

examples:
 # Setting the warning and critical threshold values to 85.0% and 92.0% CPU usage.
 dell_powerconnect_bcm_cpu_proc_default_levels = {
    'levels': (85.0, 92.0)
 }

perfdata:
 For each process, the CPU usage in '%' on the switch in 5, 60 and 300 second
 intervals.

[parameters]
parameters (dict): This check works with dictionary based parameters. The
 following keys are allowed:

  {"levels"}: A pair of warning / critical levels, given as floating point
  values, for the total CPU usage in '%'. The default values are 80.0
  (warning) and 90.0 (critical) percent CPU usage.
