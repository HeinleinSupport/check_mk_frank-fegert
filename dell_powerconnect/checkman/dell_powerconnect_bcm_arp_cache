description:
 This check determines the current number of entries in the ARP cache on Dell
 PowerConnect switches.

 This has currently been verified to work with the following Broadcom FastPath
 silicon based switch models:
   PowerConnect M6348,
   PowerConnect M8024-k

 {WARN} or {CRIT} is returned, if the number of entries in the ARP cache is
 equal or above the given thresholds. {OK} is returned otherwise.

item:
 None.

inventory:
 The inventory creates a single service check for the ARP cache on the switch
 unit.

examples:
 # Setting the warning and critical threshold values to 3000 and 3500 ARP cache entries.
 dell_powerconnect_bcm_arp_cache_default_levels = {
    'levels': (3000, 3500)
 }

perfdata:
 The current and total number of ARP cache entries and the current and total
 number of static ARP cache entries on the switch.

[parameters]
parameters (dict): This check works with dictionary based parameters. The
 following keys are allowed:

  {"levels"}: A pair of warning / critical levels, given as integer values,
  for the number of ARP cache entries. The default values are 3072 (warning)
  and 3584 (critical) ARP cache entries.
