## Check_MK Plugins

This repository holds a copy of my Check_MK plugins. Each sub-directory contains
one plugin including a README.md with install instructions. The directory structure
of each plugins sub-directory mirrors the directory structure of the upstream
Check_MK sources available here: <http://git.mathias-kettner.de/check_mk.git>

A more in-depth discussion of each plugin along with some examples can be found
[on my blog](https://www.bityard.org/). Check out the README.md of each plugins
sub-directory for a link to the particular blog post.
