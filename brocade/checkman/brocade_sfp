description:
 This check monitors the SFP of a FibreChannel port of Brocade Fibre Channel
 switches. SFP data is currently available for 8, 16 and 32 GBit FC SFPs only.

 The following metrics are provided by this check:

 {sfp_temp} The operational temperature level as reported by the SFP in degrees
 celsius. Default temperature levels for warning and critical are 50 and 60
 degrees celsius. These are configurable via WATO.

 {sfp_voltage} The operational voltage level as reported by the SFP. This metric
 is used for trending only.

 {sfp_current} The operational current level as reported by the SFP. This metric
 is used for trending only.

 {sfp_rx_power} The operational power level of the received signal as reported
 by the SFP in dBm. Default receive power levels for warning and critical are
 -7.0 and -9.0 dBm. These are configurable via WATO.

 {sfp_tx_power} The operational power level of the transmitted signal as reported
 by the SFP in dBm. Default receive power levels for warning and critical are
 -2.0 and -3.0 dBm. These are configurable via WATO.

item:
 The item is the port-number as two-digit or three-digit string (on switches
 with 100 or more ports) as printed on the switch (note: the SNMP-index of
 port {00} is {1}!). For ISL ports (inter-switch-links), an {ISL} is appended
 to the item, e.g. {00 ISL}. This allows you to create rules which select
 different check parameters for ISL and normal ports without specifying each
 individual port. Also, if you have configured port names, they will appear
 in the check item (and thus the service description). This can be turned
 off.

inventory:
 The inventory creates one service for every operational port on a Brocade
 Fibre Channel switch which has a SFP installed that is able to provide
 health information.
