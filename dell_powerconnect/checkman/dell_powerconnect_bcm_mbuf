description:
 This check determines the number of memory buffer allocations for packets
 arriving at the CPU on Dell PowerConnect switches.

 This has currently been verified to work with the following Broadcom FastPath
 silicon based switch models:
   PowerConnect M6348,
   PowerConnect M8024-k

 No warning and critical threshold values are currently implemented. This
 check is purely used for the purpose of gathering performance data.

item:
 None.

inventory:
 The inventory creates a single service check for the memory buffer allocations
 on the switch unit.

examples:
 None.

perfdata:
 The amount of currently free memory buffers in the switch. For each memory
 buffer class ("Transmit", "Rx High", "Rx Mid0", "Rx Mid1", "Rx Mid2", "Rx
 Normal") the number of total and the number of failed allocation attempts.
