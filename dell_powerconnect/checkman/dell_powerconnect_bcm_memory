description:
 This check determines the current memory usage on Dell PowerConnect switches.

 This has currently been verified to work with the following Broadcom FastPath
 silicon based switch models:
   PowerConnect M6348,
   PowerConnect M8024-k

 {WARN} or {CRIT} is returned, if the amount of free memory in KBytes is equal
 or below the given thresholds. {OK} is returned otherwise.

item:
 None.

inventory:
 The inventory creates a single service check for the memory usage on the switch
 unit.

examples:
 # Setting the warning and critical threshold values to 25600 and 12800 KBytes free memory.
 dell_powerconnect_bcm_mem_default_levels = {
    'levels': (25600, 12800)
 }

perfdata:
 The total amount of memory and the amount of currently free memory in the switch.

[parameters]
parameters (dict): This check works with dictionary based parameters. The
 following keys are allowed:

  {"levels"}: A pair of warning / critical levels, given as integer values,
  for the amount of free memory in KBytes. The default values are 51200
  (warning) and 25600 (critical) KBytes of free memory.
