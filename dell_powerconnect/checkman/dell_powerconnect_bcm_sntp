description:
 This check determines the current status of the SNTP client on Dell PowerConnect
 switches.

 This has currently been verified to work with the following Broadcom FastPath
 silicon based switch models:
   PowerConnect M6348,
   PowerConnect M8024-k

 {WARN} or {CRIT} is returned, if the number of successfully queried NTP servers
 is equal or below the given thresholds. {OK} is returned otherwise.

item:
 None.

inventory:
 The inventory creates a single service check for the SNTP client on the switch
 unit.

examples:
 # Setting the warning and critical threshold values to 2 and 1 successfully queried NTP servers.
 dell_powerconnect_bcm_sntp_default_levels = {
    'levels': (2, 1)
 }

perfdata:
 The number of failed and the number of successful NTP requests for each configured NTP server.

[parameters]
parameters (dict): This check works with dictionary based parameters. The
 following keys are allowed:

  {"levels"}: A pair of warning / critical levels, given as integer values,
  for the number of NTP servers that have to be sucessfully queried. The
  default values are 1 (warning) and 0 (critical) sucessfully queried NTP
  servers.
