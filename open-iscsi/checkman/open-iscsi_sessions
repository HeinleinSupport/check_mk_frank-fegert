description:
 This check determines the current status of Open-iSCSI sessions on a
 system. The currently active iSCSI sessions are compared to a list of
 sessions discovered at inventory time. If sessions are missing {CRIT}
 is returned and an alarm is raised.

 For iSCSI sessions via a "dependent" hardware, a hardware or a software
 initiator the session state is checked and {CRIT} is returned if the
 session is not in the {LOGGED_IN} state.

 For iSCSI sessions via a software or a "dependent" hardware initiator,
 the connection status and the internal status of each iSCSI session is
 also evaluated. A {CRIT} is returned if the connection state is not
 {LOGGED_IN} or the internal state is not {NO_CHANGE}.

 A pair consisting of the iSCSI network interface name and the IQN of
 the iSCSI target volume.

inventory:
 The inventory creates a single service check for each pair of iSCSI
 network interface name and target volume IQN.
