description:
 This check determines the current temperature of Dell PowerConnect switches.

 This has currently been verified to work with the following Broadcom FastPath
 silicon based switch models:
   PowerConnect M6348,
   PowerConnect M8024-k

 {WARN} or {CRIT} is returned, if at least one of the temperature values is
 above the given thresholds. {OK} is returned otherwise.

item:
 The number of the temperature sensor and the number of the switch unit the
 temperature sensor is located in.

inventory:
 The inventory creates a service for each temperature sensor.

examples:
 # Setting the warning and critical threshold values to 46 and 51 degrees celsius.
 dell_powerconnect_bcm_temp_default_levels = {
    'levels': (46, 51)
 }

perfdata:
 The current temperature value for each temperature sensor.

[parameters]
parameters (dict): This check works with dictionary based parameters. The
 following keys are allowed:

  {"levels"}: A pair of warning / critical levels, given as integer values,
  for the sensor temperature in degrees celsius. The default values are 45
  (warning) and 50 (critical) degree celcius.
