description:
 This check determines the number of DNS queries (total and several error states
 defined by RFC-1035) on Dell PowerConnect switches.

 This has currently been verified to work with the following Broadcom FastPath
 silicon based switch models:
   PowerConnect M6348,
   PowerConnect M8024-k

 No warning and critical threshold values are currently implemented. This
 check is purely used for the purpose of gathering performance data.
