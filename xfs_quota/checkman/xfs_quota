description:
 This check determines the current overall XFS filesystem quota usage as
 reported by the "xfs_quota -c report" command. Hard and soft, block and
 inode quotas are supported.

 {WARN} or {CRIT} is returned, if the number of free XFS filesystem blocks
 or inodes is lower than the given thresholds. {OK} is returned otherwise.

 Alarms are only generated if either a hard or soft, block or inode quota
 is set to a value other than zero. For XFS filesystems with quotas enabled,
 but all four quota values set to zero, only performance data is reported
 by the check.

item:
 A pair consisting of the mount point of the filesystem and the ID of the
 quota.

inventory:
 The inventory creates a single service check for each pair of XFS filesystem
 and quota ID.

examples:
 # Setting the warning and critical threshold values to 20 and 10 free
 # filesystem blocks and inodes for soft and hard quotas.
 xfs_quota_default_levels {
    'blocks_hard': (20, 10),
    'blocks_soft': (20, 10),
    'inodes_hard': (20, 10),
    'inodes_soft': (20, 10),
 }


perfdata:
 The number of used XFS filesystem blocks an the number of used XFS filesystem
 inodes for each pair of XFS filesystem and quota ID.

[parameters]
parameters (dict): This check works with dictionary based parameters. The
 following keys are allowed:

  {"blocks_hard"}: A pair of warning / critical levels, given as integer
  values, for the number of free XFS filesystem blocks which are compared
  against the hard quota limits. The default values are 0 (warning) and 0
  (critical) free filesystem blocks.

  {"blocks_soft"}: A pair of warning / critical levels, given as integer
  values, for the number of free XFS filesystem blocks which are compared
  against the soft quota limits. The default values are 0 (warning) and 0
  (critical) free filesystem blocks.

  {"inodes_hard"}: A pair of warning / critical levels, given as integer
  values, for the number of free XFS filesystem inodes which are compared
  against the hard quota limits. The default values are 0 (warning) and 0
  (critical) free filesystem inodes.

  {"inodes_soft"}: A pair of warning / critical levels, given as integer
  values, for the number of free XFS filesystem inodes which are compared
  against the soft quota limits. The default values are 0 (warning) and 0
  (critical) free filesystem inodes.
